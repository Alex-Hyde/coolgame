# GALACTICOLOUR

# Introduction

<p>Galacticolour is a web-based, two-dimensional space shooter which takes inspiration from classic
games such as Asteroids and Space Invaders, along with a touch of the beloved mobile game Color Switch.</p>

<p>This project was developed in a team of 3 group members consisting of Alex Hyde, Sebastian Villate and Kevin Lee.
All three are First Year students at the University of Waterloo. Their respective github profiles can be found below:</p>

<p>The game was created completely from scratch using JavaScript and HTML. The project served as a challenge for the 
team that would also aid them in improving their JavaScript skills and sharpening their knowledge of its conventions.</p>

<p>The objective of Galacticolour is to complete a series of 14 levels, where the player traverses the galaxy from 
planet to planet fighting off waves of increasingly stronger enemies.</p>

<p>The user has options to change the appearance and functionality of their equipment including ship body types, projectiles
and engines. </p>
